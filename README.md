# Water_Level_Cum_Pump_Motor_Failure_Indicator_Project.
The Water Level cum Pump Motor Failure Indicator ensures efficient water management by monitoring tank levels and detecting pump failures. It uses water level sensors and a flow sensor to track water levels and motor performance. A microcontroller processes data to trigger alerts, preventing water wastage and equipment damage.
